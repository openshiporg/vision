## Vision

A visual representation of Openship's long term vision, an open-source marketplace.

To achieve this, we will need 3 parts:

1. Openship - order management system (OMS) that lets you fulfill from anywhere
2. Openfront - e-commerce platform that is the source of truth for your product catalog, pricing, sales channels, etc.
3. Opensupport - support platform that lets customers open tickets anywhere you're selling

These three platforms will standarize the marketplace allowing anyone to launch one. Furthermore, it'll bring power back to the sellers. Future marketplaces will integrate with you, not the other way around.
